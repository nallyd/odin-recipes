Project 1: Odin Recipes

This is the first project for The Odin Project. Where we create a simple
recipe website. We will revisit this later upon learning more about CSS
to add additional style and potential interactivity.

After completion we will have shown:
 * Proper use of creating + cloning a repository locally
 * Fundamental understanding of the HTML language
 * Basic healthy principles for commits
