		<p>Our easy lemon chicken recipe shines with a sunny, lemony zing.
		Garlic and herbs—plus a glug of white wine—mean that these juicy,
		tender chicken breasts are as delicious as they are healthy.</p>

		<h2>A Flavor-Giving Trifecta Makes this the Best Lemon Chicken
		Recipe, Ever.</h2> <p>Let’s start with the good news: lean and
		protein-packed, boneless, skinless chicken breast is super healthy!
		The bad news: boneless, skinless chicken breast is kind of bland!
		The solution?  Use the chicken breast as a blank canvas for all of
		your favorite big flavors, without undermining its’ inherent
		healthfulness. Our lemon chicken recipe does all of that thanks to a
		few of our favorite big, bright flavors:</p>

		<ul> <li>Lemon, three ways. We aren’t messing around—this isn’t just
		lemon chicken. It’s LEMON chicken!  We use lemon zest,
		fresh-squeezed lemon juice and whole lemon slices to give this lemon
		chicken recipe all of the citrusy punch that we possibly can.</li>
		<li>Garlic, two ways. We could maybe have called this lemon garlic
		chicken, since our recipe calls for both fresh garlic cloves and
		(you guessed it) our beloved garlic powder.</li> <li>Herbs, herbs
		and more herbs. A whole garden’s worth of fragrance and flavor, all
		from a few dried herbs that you probably already have in your
		pantry.</li> </ul>

		<h2>How To Make Lemon Chicken</h2> <p>Our easy, baked lemon chicken
		recipe is healthy, fast, and so, so delicious. The key is coating
		the lemon chicken with lots of moisture-giving things, and watching
		that internal temp closely so that you don’t over-bake the
		chicken.</p> <ol> <li>Make a lemon chicken marinade. Well, it’s
		really more like a rub or a paste, because our lemon chicken recipe
		requires no actual marinating (yay!). But basically, we coat the
		chicken breasts in a thick, olive oil-based herb paste flavored with
		oregano, thyme, garlic powder, salt and pepper.</li> <li>Make the
		lemon chicken sauce! Stir together all of the zingy things—white
		wine, fresh garlic, lemon zest, lemon juice—to make the sauce that
		the chicken breasts will bake in. You’ll also use this sauce to
		baste the chicken as it bakes, ensuring that these bright flavors
		have a chance to be absorbed by the chicken (without having to
		actually marinate the chicken).</li> <li>Bake! Until you get that
		internal temperature reading of 165°F. Then it’s time to dig
		in!</li> </ol>

		things. We hope this healthy lemon chicken recipe felt as
		miraculously breezy to you as it does to us. Let us know how it all
		went down! Snap a photo of your baked lemon chicken and maybe even a
		video of the beautiful people you feed it to. </p>
