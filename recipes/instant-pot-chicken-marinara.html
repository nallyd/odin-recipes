		<p>Once you go Instant Pot, there’s just no going back, is there? 
		Especially when it comes to making chicken for dinner, the Instant
		Pot has made our lives so much easier. This stupid-easy chicken 
		marinara recipe, which has only three ingredients, would be fast
		even without an Instant Pot. But the recipe and Instant Pot combine
		to make a dinner that’s so basic and brainless, we barely have words
		for how do-able this meal is.</p>

		<h2>Three Ingredients, You Say?</h2>
		<p>Yep! The recipe for chicken marinara is basically not-so-hidden in
		the name itself. To make it, you'll just need:</p>

			and moist.</li>
			<li>Marinara.</li>
			<li>A little salt.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>How To Make Instant Pot Chicken Marinara</h2>
		<p>Plug in that Instant Pot and carve out 20 minutes-dinner's almost
		ready.</p>

			Pot.</li>
			<li>Cook on high for 5 minutes.</li>
			<li>Let the pressure release naturally for 10 minutes.</li>
			<li>Shred the chicken thighs in the sauce, and serve!</li>
		</ol>
