		<p>Is pesto the world's most perfect pasta sauce? Maybe! That sharp,
		spicy kick of garlic, salty Parmigiano-Reggiano, fragrant fresh basil
		and good olive oil—basically pesto is a perfect thing. The only
		downside is that we feel just a teensy, tiny bit guilty when we sit
		down to a big bowl of pasta slicked only with basil pesto. Our mom’s
		voice rings in our ears as we go in for that first herby bite—”where
		are the veggies?!” Ugh. And of course, mom’s always right.</p>

		<h2>What's In Broccoli Pesto (Besides Broccoli)?</h2>
		<p>Basically, this is a basil pesto recipe, plus broccoli. It really
		is as basic as:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Broccoli florets</li>
			<li>Fresh basil</li>
			<li>Fresh garlic</li>
			<li>Pine nuts</li>
			<li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
			<li>Parmigiano-Reggiano</li>
			<li>And one secret ingredient: reserved pasta cooking water</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>How To Make Perfect Broccoli Pesto Pasta</h2>
		<p>This broccoli pesto pasta recipe is a thing of logistical beauty.
		A stock pot of boiling water does double-duty (we love that kind of
		efficiency, don’t you?) and simple ingredients come together to make
		a healthy, satisfying supper everyone can feel good about. Oh yeah,
		that’s the stuff. Here’s how to make this easy, healthy pasta
		recipe:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Prep all of your broccoli pesto ingredients—rinse the basil
			leaves, grate your Parmigiano, peel your garlic.</li>
			<li>Bring a big pot of salted water to a boil.</li>
			<li>Boil the broccoli. After two minutes, remove the florets, and
			add your pasta.</li>
			<li>While the pasta cooks, make the pesto! Blend the broccoli,
			basil, garlic, pine nuts, extra virgin olive oil, salt and parmigiano
			reggiano until it’s nice and smooth.</li>
			<li>When the pasta is done, scoop out a cup of that liquid gold
			(aka pasta water) and add it slowly to the pesto as you blend it a
			bit more.</li>
			<li>Toss the pasta with the broccoli pesto and dig in!</li>
		</ol>
